# Godot iOS GameCenter plugin

## Methods

### Authentication

* `authenticate()` - Performs user authentication.
* `is_authenticated()` - Returns authentication state.

### Leaderboards

* `post_score(Dictionary score_dictionary)` - Reports a score data to `Game Center`. Generates new event with `post_score` type.

### Achievements

* `report_achievement(String identifier, double percent_complete, bool shows_completion_banner = true)` - Reports progress of achievement data to `Game Center`.
If `percent_complete` is [100.0, then the achievement is awarded](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkachievement/percentcomplete?language=objc).
When `shows_completion_banner` is false, the native Game Center UI won't trigger so you can implement your own UI.
